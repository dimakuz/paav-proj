This example shows that analysis is able to deal with conflict after
merging branches. In this example, $x$ is known to be odd. Then code
branches to two paths, one setting $z$ to $x$ and other to $x+1$.

Inside each branch $z$'s parity is known (and is opposite to the other),
however, when branches merge, the conflict is removed.
