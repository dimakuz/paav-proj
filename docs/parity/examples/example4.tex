This examples demonstrates the advantages of using a SAT solver. This
example has 5 variables. A series of assignemnts creates relation of
similar or anti-similar parity between pairs of variables.

A chain of 4 links is stored in the abstract state: $w-u$, $u-x$, $x-y$
and $y-z$. Analysis is able to deduce the relation between $z$ and $w$.
