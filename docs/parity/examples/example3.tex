This example demonstrates that analysis is also able to track opposite
parity relation between variables. Here, since $x$ is assigned $y + 1$,
do don't know its parity but we know it is the opposite of y. We're able
to assert that exactly one of $x,y$ has to be odd (assertion on
$L4\rightarrow L5$ edge) and that is impossible for $x$ and $y$ to be of
similar parity ($L5\rightarrow L6$ edge).

Additionaly, we're able to assert that $y$ and $z$ are of similar parity
by using knowledge available about relation of $x$ and $y$.

Disclaimer, in this example code branches without \texttt{assume} nodes,
they are removed for brevity, and would have not affected the analysis.
