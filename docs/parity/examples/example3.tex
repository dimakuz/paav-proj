This example is similar to previous one, except for the final assertion. In second example analysis was able to deduce that $i$ and $j$ are of similar parity. Here, we demonstrate that we're also able to deduce that parity of $j$ is similar to parity of $n$. 

 Here, our abstract state at assert node contains information that $i$ and $n$ are of same parity, additionally, $i$ is of same parity as $j$. SMT solver is able to deduce that $j$ is of same parity as $n$.
