This example demonstrates that analysis is able to deduce parity of
variables in relation to other variables.

Here, after $x := y$ assignment analysis knows that variables are of
same parity, without knowing the concrete parity of either.

This can be seen in the state of $L3$ where $x$'s line contains $y$
in the second element (symbols of similar parity).
