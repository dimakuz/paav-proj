First example of the parity analysis demonstrates the ability to deduce
parity of variables based on constant assignment/assumption.  The code
below demonstrates how parity of $x$ and $y$ is deduced from constants
that appear in the code.

The below control flow graph details the nodes of the program, inside
them, the abstract state of the node. The format of the state is as
following: $var: M, S, A$, where $M$ is the modulo state of the variable
(e.g. E for even), $S$ details all the variables $var$ is possibly in
the same parity with, and $A$ details the same with opposite parity.

Additionally, violating statements are displayed in red (relevant for
asserts).
