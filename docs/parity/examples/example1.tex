First example of the parity analysis demonstrates the ability to deduce parity of variables based on constant assignment. In below code, $n$ is assigned 0, (thus known to be even), then $i$ is assigned $n+1$ thus known to be odd. Then $n$ is assigned a random value, and program iterates until $n = i$. The analysis successfully asserts that both $n$ and $i$ are odd. 

The below control flow graph details the nodes of the program, inside them, the abstract state of the node. The format of the state is as following: $var: M, S, A$, where $M$ is the modulo state of the variable (e.g. E for even), $S$ details all the variables $var$ is possibly in the same parity with, and $A$ details the same with opposite parity.
