\section*{Overview}
In the first analysis we implemented, we built an abstract state that tracks parity properties of the variables. The abstract state aims to track the following aspects of execution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Storing parity of variables when they are assigned a specific value
	\item Storing a relation of similar parity between a pair of variables when one is assigned to the other.
	\item Storing a relation of opposite parity when one is assigned $\pm1$ of another variable.
\end{itemize}

With this information stored in the state, we're able to verify \texttt{assert} predicates (details in next section).
