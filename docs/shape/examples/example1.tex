First example of the shape analysis is taken from the presentation in class. First we create a singly linked list with an arbitrary length, and then we iterate over the list, asserting that \texttt{tmp} variable is not NULL during the iteration.

Inside the nodes of the control flow graph we have the number of valid structures in the abstract state. The graphs of the structures themselves are attached separately.
