This examples demonstrates the ability of the analysis to deduce reachability and cycle properties. Here we create a singly linked list of arbitrary length and afterwards point its head to its tail, creating a cycle.

We iterate over the list, incrementing \texttt{tmp} and \texttt{h} pointers, asserting on the way that \texttt{h} is reachable from \texttt{tmp} and vice versa owing to the fact that they are both on a cycle.
