This example demonstrates that analysis is able to deduce parity of length between nodes. We create a singly linked list with an even number of nodes by creating at each iteration two nodes at once.

In the end we can assert that the length between \texttt{y} and \texttt{yy} is even. If we look closely at the set of structures, we find a structure with a node with size $2 + 2\cdot PL6$. $PL6$ is a permanent arbitrary size labeled by the line number of the \texttt{assume} statement. Because $2+2\cdot PL6 = 2(1+PL6)$, and $PL6$ is a positive integer, we deduce that this size is in fact always even.
