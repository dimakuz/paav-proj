Next example demonstrates the deduction of deltas between variables with
no direct assigment or relation. In the example we establish deltas
$a-b=-1$ and $c-d = 1$. Them we add the information that $a=d$. The
analysis is able to deduce all the deltas among $a,b,c,d$ and finally
assert that $b=c$ even when we wipe info about $a$.
