In the next example we show the usefulness of tracking deltas between
variables. The example contains begins with setting $b=0$ and $c=0$,
then program iterates a random number of times, incremeting $b$ and $c$
each iteration. The analysis is able to deduce that after the loop, $b$
and $c$ still differ by 1.
