This example demonstrates a weakness point of the analysis. Due to the nature of saving only a single possible value for each variable, and only a single possible delta for any pair of variables, our analysis loses a lot of information on merges.

In this example we have code that branches into 2 executions. In either of the branches, it holds that $a + b = c$ although values of the variables are different. Each of the branches is able to successfully assert the equation, yet, after the paths merge, needed information is lost and becomes unavailable.
