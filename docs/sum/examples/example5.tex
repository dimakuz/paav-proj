This example shows one of the weaknesses of the analysis. Our analysis
uses a very simple lattice of values for sums and delta, this means that
we either have a concrete value for a given sum, a $\top$ or a $\bot$.
This means that when program branches, and there's a conflict between
concrete values, value is assumed to be $\top$ and information is lost.

This example asserts that value of $a$ is either 2 or 3. It is indeed
true because each of the branches assigns one of those values, and
asserts hold on the branches.  Once the branches merge, value of $a$
becomes $\top$ and the same assertion that held on both of the branches
is no longer proveable.
