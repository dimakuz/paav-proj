This example shows the deduction of sums from other available sums. This
program branches into two path, where on both, variables are set such
that $a+b+c=10$, but no two variables are set to the same value. Upon
merging, only the sum remains in the state.

Next, program branches again, assuming the value of $a$ that was given
in one of the branches. Analysis is able to decude the value of $b+c$
based on information available in the state.
