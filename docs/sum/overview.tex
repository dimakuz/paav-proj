\section*{Overview}
In our implementation of summation analysis we tried to capture the following aspects of execution:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Storing known constant values of variable or sets of variables.
	\item Storing differences between pairs of variables.
\end{itemize}
We used an SMT solver to check whether information provided by our abstract state conflicts with assertion predicates or not.
