\section*{Overview}
In our implementation of summation analysis we implemented an abstract state that tracks 2 aspects of the program:
\begin{itemize}
\item Known constant values of variables.
\item Known differences between pairs of variables.
\end{itemize}
To deduce whether a given assert can be violated, we used an SMT solver that processed a conjunction of equations based on the information gathered by our abstract state.

\subsection*{Example}
Consider a program with 2 variables $x$ and $y$. In an abstract state that knows that $x$ is equal to 0 and that $y$ is equal to $x+1$, we can create the following model:

\begin{equation*}
	(x = 2) \wedge (y = x + 1)
\end{equation*}

Then, when checking an assert, we use this model, along with predicate defined by the assert, to find an assignment to variables that holds the model yet violates the predicate.
